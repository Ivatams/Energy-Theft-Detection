# Energy-Theft-Detection
ML for energy theft detection
Estimate suggest that Non Technical Loss(NTL) in any sub-saharan power distribution company may range up to 40% of the total energy received from the grid. Industrial NTL detection systems are still largely based on expert knowledge when deciding whether to carry out costly on-site inspections of customers. As a company we are reluctant to move to large-scale deployments of automated systems that learn NTL profiles from data due to the latter's propensity to suggest a large number of unnecessary inspections. In this project, we used a novel system that combines automated statistical decision making with expert knowledge. First, we deployed a machine learning framework that classifies customers based on their likelihood of meter byepass using a variety of features derived from the customers' consumption data.

The methodology used is specifically tailored to the level of noise in the data. Second, in order to allow human experts to feed their knowledge in the decision loop, we built a method for visualizing prediction results at various granularity levels in a spatial hologram.
